Herbal medicine is the use of medicinal plants for prevention and treatment of diseases: it
ranges from traditional and popular medicines of every country to the use of standardized and
tritated herbal extracts. Generally cultural rootedness enduring and widespread use in a
Traditional Medical System may indicate safety, but not efficacy of treatments, especially in
herbal medicine where tradition is almost completely based on remedies containing active principles at very low and ultra low concentrations, or relying on magical-energetic principles.
In the age of globalization and of the so-called ‘plate world’, assessing the ‘transferability’ of
treatments between different cultures is not a relevant goal for clinical research, while are the
assessment of efficacy and safety that should be based on the regular patterns of mainstream
clinical medicine.
The other black box of herbal-based treatments is the lack of definite and complete information
about the composition of extracts. Herbal derived remedies need a powerful and deep
assessment of their pharmacological qualities and safety that actually can be realized by new
biologic technologies like pharmacogenomic, metabolomic and microarray methology. Because
of the large and growing use of natural derived substances in all over the world, it is not wise to
rely also on the tradition or supposed millenarian beliefs; explanatory and pragmatic studies are
useful and should be considered complementary in the acquisition of reliable data both for
health caregiver and patients.

Herbs are natural products and their chemical composition varies depending on several factors and therefore
varying from people to people, from energetic decoctions
to the use of herbal extracts following Western methodologies of mainstream medicine. Traditional medicines
has a very long history: it is the sum total of the practices
based on the theories, beliefs and experiences of different
cultures and times, often inexplicable, used in the maintenance of health, as like in the prevention, diagnosis,
improvement and treatment of illnesses.
In every country traditional medicines find foundation
in magical or religious beliefs, or popular experience and
the World Health Organization is engaged to establish
definitive guidelines for methodology of clinical research
and the appraisal of effectiveness of traditional medicine
European Traditional Herbalism
For centuries traditional medical systems (TMS) were the
primary medical system in the countries of origin, and
now nevertheless the present dominance of the Western
scientific medical model, citizens and health-caregivers
are starting to rely and trust TMS substituting conventional scientifically proved therapies with unconventional
ones. Generally cultural rootedness enduring and widespread use of TMS may indicate safety, but not the
efficacy of the treatments especially in herbal medicines
where tradition is almost completely based on remedies
containing active principles at very low and ultra low

In European traditional herbalism categories similar
to Asiatic medicines, referring to ‘humoral-energetic
doctrines’ that has qualities (like heat, cold, dry,
humid), and elements (fire, air, water, earth, etc.) are
used. European popular medicine still counsel the
so-called depurative plants for treatment of dermatological illnesses, like psoriasis or eczemas, like it were due to
intoxications, as well as diuretic plants for arthritis, or a
decoction of Stachys (called ‘herb of fear’) used as bath
to wash out fears, or hay baths as treatment of cancer.
A discussion on methodologies for research and
evaluation of traditional medicine should be divided in
two parts: herbal medicines and traditional procedurebased therapies.
Herbal medicine has become a popular form of
healthcare; even though several differences exist between
herbal and conventional pharmacological treatments,
herbal medicine needs to be tested for efficacy using
conventional trial methodology and several specific
herbal extracts have been demonstrated to be efficacious
for specific conditions. Nevertheless the public is often
misleded to believe that all natural treatments are
inherently safe, herbal medicines do carry risks, so
research in this area must be intensified. The main question that has not been often answered satisfactorily deal
with the triad absorption/metabolism/efficacy of herbs
and their extracts and is actually an important unsolved
problem in judging their many alleged health effects (1).
Mind–body medicine can be considered as a complementary or an alternative mode to traditional Western
medicine, and a variety of other modes of interventions
that are presently used in a CAM paradigm may act in
large part via the mind–body connection (2); and in this
sense trusting in the traditional principles of a medicine
that is deeply rooted in a culture can represent a type of
mind-body connection having a real pharmacological
activity through a placebo like effect. So a successful
treatment is often the consequence of both types of
treatments acting synergistically, nevertheless efficacy
assessment of traditional medicines cannot be different
from that of conventional medicine.
Long-term use of medicinal herbs enables a process of
selection but limited and only partial, of short and
medium-term safe remedies, that however does not match
with modern issues relatives to the interferences with
synthetic drugs. Treatment selection is often limited
because of the multiple meaning of efficacy in relation
to pathology and diseases in different cultures.
The transfer of a medical concept to a new country
may be really misleading and lead to deep modifications
of its medical-therapeutic and cultural essence, especially
if a remedy is part of a TMS, and modifications follow
adaptation to local conditions and cultural habits. These
modifications may deeply vary in extension, but probably
years or just moths after migration a TMS can have
absorbed cultural influences form the host country (3).
Efficacy and Effectiveness of a Traditional
Herbal Remedy
To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of a
traditional herbal remedy requires answers to some basic
questions:
(i) Which treatment should be studied?
(ii) Can it be studied following the patterns of modern
science protocols?
(iii) Is it scientifically correct to transfer a remedy
directly in another country?
(iv) Does already exist a conventional treatment safe
and effective?
(v) Is ethically correct to study that type of remedy?
Several factors are important in determining the outcome
of any traditional treatment, both in experimental and
clinical settings including forma mentis, beliefs, knowledge and practical abilities of the provider, as well as the
positive or negative prejudices of the patient with respect
to the provider of the therapy, cultural differences in the
acceptability of the treatment and adherence to it, the
patient–doctor encounter, and differences in access to
other treatments (4). In the age of globalization and of
the so-called ‘plate world’, assessing the ‘transferability’
of treatments in herbal medicines is not a relevant goal
for clinical research, while efficacy and safety should be
based on the normal patterns of mainstream clinical
medicine. The CONSORT statement for trials of herbal
medicines (5) can be a very important paradigm to
follow; and in fact it elaborated 9 of the 22 CONSORT
checklist items to enhance their relevance to trials of

38 Herbal medicine today: clinical and research issues
herbal interventions, including minor recommendations
for eight items. Besides, Nahin and Straus from the
National Center of Complementary and Alternative
Medicine (NCCAM) proposed a pragmatic schema for
allocation of resources in the USA. The authors
recommend five criteria: quantity and quality of available
preliminary data to help determine the most appropriate
type of research; extent of use by the public; public health
importance of the disease being treated; feasibility of
conducting the research; cost of the research (6).
It is very important to keep in mind the differences
between explanatory and pragmatic studies, and the
concepts of efficacy and effectiveness (7); efficacy is the
benefit a treatment produces under ideal conditions,
often using carefully defined subjects, while effectiveness
defines the benefit the treatment produces in routine
clinical practice (8). Explanatory trials evaluate the
efficacy of a treatment under controlled conditions that
optimize isolation of the treatment effect through design
features, such as a control or placebo, randomization,
standardized protocols, homogeneous samples, blindness;
these type of studies often represent the treatment of a
particular patient, that is not the usual patient that enter
a medical office. Pragmatic studies do not provide
conclusive information on the specificity of the treatment
effect but they have some interesting characteristics.
Pragmatic studies in Traditional Medicine
Pragmatic trials (PT) are designed to find out about how
effective a treatment actually is in everyday practice; while
explanatory trials are designed to find out whether a
treatment has any efficacy, almost always compared with
placebo under ideal conditions. PT answers questions about
the overall effectiveness of an intervention, and cannot
study the contributions of its different components.
The participant to these studies will need to be representative of the wider population because results need to be
generalized; so wide criteria of inclusion are needed, so that
patients having more medical diseases or taking different
medications are included. It would be more satisfactory and
sensible to choose conditions where conventional treatment
is often unsatisfactory like irritable bowel syndrome or
panic crises. In PT it is not usually mandatory to use a
placebo, while it is needed with both arms of the trial on
normal practice, since the aim is to produce an evidence to
facilitate a real practical choice. The treatment protocol is
more complex because patients with wider criteria are
included, so is necessary a larger sample of patients, and
may need a handbook that defines parameters for treatment
(9). The main advantage of PT is that they can deliver
evidence of effectiveness directly in clinical practice (10).
Nevertheless they have important methodological limits:
most of all the lack of placebo and blindness, increased
costs, the need of several therapists, more complexity and
lack of clarification about the mechanism of action; but PT
should be seen not as an alternative to explanatory studies,
but as a mandatory complement that define and improve
evidence primarily coming from explanatory trials, the only
one that can reliably confirm efficacy.
The Chemical Constituents of
Herbal Remedies
The other black box of herbal-based treatments is the
lack of information about the composition of the remedy.
Herbs are natural products and their chemical composition varies depending on several factors, such as
botanical species, used chemotypes, the anatomical part

and also storage, sun, humidity, type of ground, time of

containing on the label the same product varying in their
content and concentrations of chemical constituents from
batch to batch; and even the same manufacturer can
merchandize in different periods products containing
different substances although standardized to achieve a
high pharmaceutical quality. This variability can result in
significant differences in pharmacological activity: involving both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic issues.
Adverse and side effects is another open problem,
because in citizens still prevail the respect for everything
that is natural tout court, more as a cultural-fashionbased choice than thinking that the patient is introducing
in his/her body chemical substances of vegetal origin; not
knowing that salicylic glucosides and lactonic sesquiterpenes of many Compositae are often responsible of
allergic reactions; that some constituents of plants are
cancerogenic like safrole, bergapten and pyrrolizidines
alkaloids. Not of minor importance especially for the old
patient using contemporary more synthetic drugs is the
problem of drug interferences; some plants reduce or
improve the bioavailability of some drugs due to
induction or inhibition of cytochromes (St. John’s Wort
extracts, grapefruit juice, and so on). Moreover the use of
herbal extracts during pregnancy or lactaction should
undergo strict medical supervision because many herbs
have not been studied neither in pregnant mice.
Advances in high-throughput experimentations have
resulted in massive databases of genomic, proteomic and
chemical data which in combination with efficient
separation methods and powerful spectrometric methods
for identification and structure elucidation can be used
for identification of active compounds (11). A powerful
and deep biological approach that integrates such large
and diverse sources of information together actually
needs to fully understand the pharmacological effects
of natural products; and DNA microarrays may provide
a suitable high-throughput platform for research and
development of drugs from natural products (11). There
are three main applications of DNA microarrays: in
pharmacodynamics for discovery of new drugs; in pharmacogenomics for prediction of side-effects; in pharmacognosy for correct botanical identification and authentication
of crude plant materials as part of standardization and
quality control (11).
Conclusions
Herbal-derived remedies need a powerful and deep
assessment of their pharmacological qualities and safety
issues due to the large and growing use of natural-derived
substances all over the world, which cannot rely only on
the tradition or supposed millenarian beliefs; explanatory
and pragmatic studies are useful and complementary in
the acquisition of reliable data both for health caregiver
and patients
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was first conceived by
Archibald Cochrane as a cultural and methodological
approach to clinical practice to make decisions; based on
clinical expertise and the most intimate knowledge of the
individual patient’s clinical situations, it de-emphasizes
unsystematic clinical experience as ground for medical
decision-making, and stresses the rigorous analysis of
evidence from clinical research. An important problematic of EBM is the difficulty to be easily applied in
everyday practice, in a ABC system, especially in the field
of complementary medicine, and probably pragmatic
studies can be a useful tool in reaching this major
objective as part of the systematic process of knowledge.
The quality, reliability and possibility of publishing
a study are decisively influenced by the selection
of a proper study design. The study type is a component
of the study design (see the article "Study Design in
Medical Research") and must be specified before the
study starts. The study type is determined by the question
to be answered and decides how useful a scientific study
is and how well it can be interpreted. If the wrong study
type has been selected, this cannot be rectified once the
study has started.
After an earlier publication dealing with aspects of
study design, the present article deals with study types in
primary and secondary research. The article focuses on
study types in primary research. A special article will be
devoted to study types in secondary research, such as
meta-analyses and reviews. This article covers the classification of individual study types. The conception,
implementation, advantages, disadvantages and possibilities of using the different study types are illustrated
by examples. The article is based on a selective literature
research on study types in medical research, as well as
the authors' own experience.
Classification of study types
In principle, medical research is classified into primary
and secondary research. While secondary research summarizes available studies in the form of reviews and
meta-analyses, the actual studies are performed in
primary research. Three main areas are distinguished:
basic medical research, clinical research, and epidemiological research. In individual cases, it may be difficult
to classify individual studies to one of these three main
categories or to the subcategories. In the interests of
clarity and to avoid excessive length, the authors will
dispense with discussing special areas of research, such
as health services research, quality assurance, or clinical
epidemiology. Figure 1 gives an overview of the different study types in medical research.
Basic research
Basic medical research (otherwise known as experimental research) includes animal experiments, cell
studies, biochemical, genetic and physiological investigations, and studies on the properties of drugs and
materials. In almost all experiments, at least one

SUMMARY
Background: The choice of study type is an important
aspect of the design of medical studies. The study design
and consequent study type are major determinants of
a study’s scientific quality and clinical value.
Methods: This article describes the structured classification
of studies into two types, primary and secondary, as well
as a further subclassification of studies of primary type.
This is done on the basis of a selective literature search
concerning study types in medical research, in addition to
the authors’ own experience.
Results: Three main areas of medical research can be
distinguished by study type: basic (experimental), clinical,
and epidemiological research. Furthermore, clinical and
epidemiological studies can be further subclassified as
either interventional or noninterventional.
Conclusions: The study type that can best answer the
particular research question at hand must be determined
not only on a purely scientific basis, but also in view of the
available financial resources, staffing, and practical
feasibility (organization, medical prerequisites, number of
patients, etc.). Dtsch Arztebl Int 2009; 106(15): 262–8

independent variable is varied and the effects on the
dependent variable are investigated. The procedure and
the experimental design can be precisely specified and
implemented (1). For example, the population, number
of groups, case numbers, treatments and dosages can be
exactly specified. It is also important that confounding
factors should be specifically controlled or reduced. In
experiments, specific hypotheses are investigated and
causal statements are made. High internal validity
(= unambiguity) is achieved by setting up standardized
experimental conditions, with low variability in the
units of observation (for example, cells, animals or
materials). External validity is a more difficult issue.
Laboratory conditions cannot always be directly transferred to normal clinical practice and processes in isolated cells or in animals are not equivalent to those in
man (= generalizability) (2).
Basic research also includes the development and
improvement of analytical procedures—such as analytical
determination of enzymes, markers or genes—, imaging
procedures—such as computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging—, and gene sequencing—such as
the link between eye color and specific gene sequences.
The development of biometric procedures—such as
statistical test procedures, modeling and statistical evaluation strategies—also belongs here.
Clinical studies
Clinical studies include both interventional (or experimental) studies and noninterventional (or observational)
studies. Aclinical drug study is an interventional clinical
study, defined according to §4 Paragraph 23 of the
Medicines Act [Arzneimittelgesetz; AMG] as "any study
performed on man with the purpose of studying or
demonstrating the clinical or pharmacological effects of
drugs, to establish side effects, or to investigate absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination, with the
aim of providing clear evidence of the efficacy or safety
of the drug."
Interventional studies also include studies on medical
devices and studies in which surgical, physical or psychotherapeutic procedures are examined. In contrast to
clinical studies, §4 Paragraph 23 of the AMG describes
noninterventional studies as follows: "Anoninterventional
study is a study in the context of which knowledge from
the treatment of persons with drugs in accordance with
the instructions for use specified in their registration is
analyzed using epidemiological methods. The diagnosis,
treatment and monitoring are not performed according
to a previously specified study protocol, but exclusively
according to medical practice."
The aim of an interventional clinical study is to compare treatment procedures within a patient population,

MEDICINE
which should exhibit as few as possible internal differences, apart from the treatment (4, e1). This is to be
achieved by appropriate measures, particularly by random
allocation of the patients to the groups, thus avoiding
bias in the result. Possible therapies include a drug, an
operation, the therapeutic use of a medical device such
as a stent, or physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychosocial
intervention, rehabilitation measures, training or diet.
Vaccine studies also count as interventional studies in
Germany and are performed as clinical studies according
to the AMG.
Interventional clinical studies are subject to a
variety of legal and ethical requirements, including the
Medicines Act and the Law on Medical Devices. Studies
with medical devices must be registered by the responsible authorities, who must also approve studies with
drugs. Drug studies also require a favorable ruling
from the responsible ethics committee. A study must
be performed in accordance with the binding rules of
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (5, e2–e4). For clinical
studies on persons capable of giving consent, it is
absolutely essential that the patient should sign a
declaration of consent (informed consent) (e2). Acontrol
group is included in most clinical studies. This group
receives another treatment regimen and/or placebo—a
therapy without substantial efficacy. The selection of
the control group must not only be ethically defensible,
but also be suitable for answering the most important
questions in the study (e5).
Clinical studies should ideally include randomization,
in which the patients are allocated by chance to the
therapy arms. This procedure is performed with random
numbers or computer algorithms (6–8). Randomization
ensures that the patients will be allocated to the different
groups in a balanced manner and that possible
confounding factors—such as risk factors, comorbidities
and genetic variabilities—will be distributed by chance
between the groups (structural equivalence) (9, 10).
Randomization is intended to maximize homogeneity
between the groups and prevent, for example, a specific
therapy being reserved for patients with a particularly
favorable prognosis (such as young patients in good
physical condition) (11).
Blinding is another suitable method to avoid bias. A
distinction is made between single and double blinding.
With single blinding, the patient is unaware which treatment he is receiving, while, with double blinding, neither
the patient nor the investigator knows which treatment
is planned. Blinding the patient and investigator excludes
possible subjective (even subconscious) influences on
the evaluation of a specific therapy (e.g. drug administration versus placebo). Thus, double blinding ensures
that the patient or therapy groups are both handled and
observed in the same manner. The highest possible
degree of blinding should always be selected. The study
statistician should also remain blinded until the details
of the evaluation have finally been specified.
A well designed clinical study must also include case
number planning. This ensures that the assumed therapeutic effect can be recognized as such, with a previously
Graphical depiction of a prospective cohort study (simplest case [2a])

MEDICINE
specified statistical probability (statistical power) (4, 6,
12).
It is important for the performance of a clinical trial
that it should be carefully planned and that the exact
clinical details and methods should be specified in the
study protocol (13). It is, however, also important that
the implementation of the study according to the protocol,
as well as data collection, must be monitored. For a first
class study, data quality must be ensured by double data
entry, programming plausibility tests, and evaluation by
a biometrician. International recommendations for the
reporting of randomized clinical studies can be found in
the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials, www.consort-statement.org) (14).
Many journals make this an essential condition for
publication.
For all the methodological reasons mentioned above
and for ethical reasons, the randomized controlled and
blinded clinical trial with case number planning is
accepted as the gold standard for testing the efficacy and
safety of therapies or drugs (4, e1, 15).
In contrast, noninterventional clinical studies (NIS)
are patient-related observational studies, in which
patients are given an individually specified therapy.
The responsible physician specifies the therapy on the
basis of the medical diagnosis and the patient's wishes.
NIS include noninterventional therapeutic studies,
prognostic studies, observational drug studies, secondary
data analyses, case series and single case analyses (13,
16). Similarly to clinical studies, noninterventional
therapy studies include comparison between therapies;
however, the treatment is exclusively according to
the physician’s discretion. The evaluation is often
retrospective. Prognostic studies examine the influence
of prognostic factors (such as tumor stage, functional
state, or body mass index) on the further course of a
disease. Diagnostic studies are another class of
observational studies, in which either the quality of a
diagnostic method is compared to an established
method (ideally a gold standard), or an investigator is
compared with one or several other investigators (interrater comparison) or with himself at different time
points (intra-rater comparison) (e1). If an event is very
rare (such as a rare disease or an individual course of
treatment), a single-case study, or a case series, are
possibilities. A case series is a study on a larger patient
group with a specific disease. For example, after the
discovery of the AIDS virus, the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) in the USA collected a case series of
1000 patients, in order to study frequent complications
of this infection. The lack of a control group is a disadvantage of case series. For this reason, case series are
primarily used for descriptive purposes (3).
Epidemiological studies
The main point of interest in epidemiological studies is
to investigate the distribution and historical changes in
the frequency of diseases and the causes for these. Analogously to clinical studies, a distinction is made between experimental and observational epidemiological
studies (16, 17).
Interventional studies are experimental in character
and are further subdivided into field studies (sample
from an area, such as a large region or a country) and
group studies (sample from a specific group, such as a
specific social or ethnic group). One example was the
investigation of the iodine supplementation of cooking
salt to prevent cretinism in a region with iodine deficiency. On the other hand, many interventions are
unsuitable for randomized intervention studies, for
ethical, social or political reasons, as the exposure may
be harmful to the subjects (17).
Observational epidemiological studies can be further
subdivided into cohort studies (follow-up studies), case

control studies, cross-sectional studies (prevalence
studies), and ecological studies (correlation studies or
studies with aggregated data).
In contrast, studies with only descriptive evaluation
are restricted to a simple depiction of the frequency (incidence and prevalence) and distribution of a disease
within a population. The objective of the description
may also be the regular recording of information (monitoring, surveillance). Registry data are also suited for
the description of prevalence and incidence; for example,
they are used for national health reports in Germany.
In the simplest case, cohort studies involve the observation of two healthy groups of subjects over time. One
group is exposed to a specific substance (for example,
workers in a chemical factory) and the other is not exposed. It is recorded prospectively (into the future) how
often a specific disease (such as lung cancer) occurs in
the two groups (figure 2a). The incidence for the occurrence of the disease can be determined for both groups.
Moreover, the relative risk (quotient of the incidence
rates) is a very important statistical parameter which can
be calculated in cohort studies. For rare types of exposure,
the general population can be used as controls (e6). All
evaluations naturally consider the age and gender distributions in the corresponding cohorts. The objective of
cohort studies is to record detailed information on the
exposure and on confounding factors, such as the duration of employment, the maximum and the cumulated
exposure. One well known cohort study is the British
Doctors Study, which prospectively examined the effect
of smoking on mortality among British doctors over a
period of decades (e7). Cohort studies are well suited for
detecting causal connections between exposure and the
development of disease. On the other hand, cohort studies
often demand a great deal of time, organization, and
money. So-called historical cohort studies represent a
special case. In this case, all data on exposure and effect
(illness) are already available at the start of the study and
are analyzed retrospectively. For example, studies of
this sort are used to investigate occupational forms of
cancer. They are usually cheaper (16).
In case control studies, cases are compared with controls. Cases are persons who fall ill from the disease in
question. Controls are persons who are not ill, but are
otherwise comparable to the cases. A retrospective analysis is performed to establish to what extent persons in
the case and control groups were exposed (figure 2b).
Possible exposure factors include smoking, nutrition
and pollutant load. Care should be taken that the intensity
and duration of the exposure is analyzed as carefully and
in as detailed a manner as possible. If it is observed that
ill people are more often exposed than healthy people, it
may be concluded that there is a link between the illness
and the risk factor. In case control studies, the most
important statistical parameter is the odds ratio. Case
control studies usually require less time and fewer
resources than cohort studies (16). The disadvantage of
case control studies is that the incidence rate (rate of
new cases) cannot be calculated. There is also a great
risk of bias from the selection of the study population
("selection bias") and from faulty recall ("recall bias")
(see too the article "Avoiding Bias in Observational
Studies"). Table 1 presents an overview of possible
types of epidemiological study (e8). Table 2 summarizes
the advantages and disadvantages of observational
studies (16).
Discussion
Selecting the correct study type is an important aspect of
study design (see "Study Design in Medical Research" in
volume 11/2009). However, the scientific questions can
only be correctly answered if the study is planned and
performed at a qualitatively high level (e9). It is very important to consider or even eliminate possible interfering

factors (or confounders), as otherwise the result cannot
be adequately interpreted. Confounders are characteristics
which influence the target parameters. Although this
influence is not of primary interest, it can interfere with
the connection between the target parameter and the factors that are of interest. The influence of confounders can
be minimized or eliminated by standardizing the procedure, stratification (18), or adjustment (19).
The decision as to which study type is suitable to
answer a specific primary research question must be
based not only on scientific considerations, but also on
issues related to resources (personnel and finances),
hospital capacity, and practicability. Many epidemiological studies can only be implemented if there is
access to registry data. The demands for planning,
implementation, and statistical evaluation for observational studies should be just as high for observational
studies as for experimental studies. There are particularly
strict requirements, with legally based regulations (such
as the Medicines Act and Good Clinical Practice), for
the planning, implementation, and evaluation of clinical
studies. A study protocol must be prepared for both
interventional and noninterventional studies (6, 13). The
study protocol must contain information on the conditions, question to be answered (objective), the methods
of measurement, the implementation, organization, study
population, data management, case number planning,
the biometric evaluation, and the clinical relevance of
the question to be answered (13).
Important and justified ethical considerations may
restrict studies with optimal scientific and statistical features. A randomized intervention study under strictly
controlled conditions of the effect of exposure to harmful factors (such as smoking, radiation, or a fatty diet) is
not possible and not permissible for ethical reasons.
Observational studies are a possible alternative to interventional studies, even though observational studies are
less reliable and less easy to control (17).
A medical study should always be published in a peer
reviewed journal. Depending on the study type, there
are recommendations and checklists for presenting the
results. For example, these may include a description of
the population, the procedure for missing values and
confounders, and information on statistical parameters.
Recommendations and guidelines are available for
clinical studies (14, 20, e10, e11), for diagnostic studies
(21, 22, e12), and for epidemiological studies (23, e13).
Since 2004, the WHO has demanded that studies should
be registered in a public registry, such as www.controlledtrials.com or www.clinicaltrials.gov. This demand is
supported by the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors (ICMJE) (24), which specifies that the
registration of the study before inclusion of the first subject is an essential condition for the publication of the
study results (e14).
When specifying the study type and study design for
medical studies, it is essential to collaborate with an
experienced biometrician. The quality and reliability of
the study can be decisively improved if all important
details are planned together (12, 25)
Introduction
Traditional herbal medicines are
naturally occurring, plant-derived
substances with minimal or no industrial
processing that have been used to treat
illness within local or regional healing
practices. Traditional herbal medicines
are getting significant attention in global
health debates. In China, traditional
herbal medicine played a prominent
role in the strategy to contain
and treat severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS).1
 Eighty per cent of
African populations use some form
of traditional herbal medicine,2,3 and
the worldwide annual market for these
products approaches US$ 60 billion.2
Many hope traditional herbal medicine
research will play a critical role in
global health. China, India, Nigeria,
the United States of America (USA)
and WHO have all made substantial
research investments in traditional
herbal medicines.2
 Industry has also
invested millions of US dollars looking
for promising medicinal herbs and
novel chemical compounds.4,5 This is
still a relatively modest investment
compared to the overall pharmaceutical
industry; however, it raises interesting
ethical questions, some of which are
not faced in more conventional drug
development.
As attention and public funding
for international traditional herbal
medicine research collaborations
grows, more detailed analysis of ethical
issues in this research is warranted.
Scant literature has addressed selected
issues such as informed consent and
independent review related to traditional herbal medicine research.6,7 Here
we apply a practical, comprehensive
and widely accepted ethical framework
to international traditional herbal
medicine research.8
 We examine in detail difficult questions related to social
value, scientific validity and favourable
risk–benefit ratio. We conclude with
implications for future research in this
area, focusing on the importance of
collaborative partnership.
Case
A government agency from a developed country is conducting an HIVtreatment trial in Africa. A traditional
herbal medicine, Africa Flower, has
been used for decades to treat wasting
symptoms associated with HIV. Local
traditional medicine healers believe
Africa Flower is an effective antiviral.
It is already widely used for immune
boosting in AIDS. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies suggest potential
interference with vaccines, and animal
models show liver toxicity at very high
doses. There are no systemic side-effects
reported for humans in the literature.
A few case series have shown mixed
results. Local leaders are requesting the
government agency conduct a large,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
Africa Flower to test its efficacy as a
novel adjunctive therapy to slow progression to AIDS.
Ethical framework
Cases like these present challenging
questions related to the role of traditional
herbal medicines in public health.
In general, international research on
traditional herbal medicines should be
subject to the same ethical requirements
as all research related to human subjects.9
An ethical framework previously
outlined by Emanuel et al. and revised
for international research8
 offers a useful
starting point for thinking about the
ethics of international traditional herbal
medicine research. This framework
includes eight ethical requirements
for clinical research (Table 1). 8

These ethical requirements are universal
and comprehensive but must be adapted
to the particular social context in which
the research is implemented.8
 Of these,
fair subject selection, independent
review, informed consent, and respect
for enrolled subjects have been discussed
previously in the literature on the
ethics of global health research and
raise few issues unique to international
traditional herbal medicine research.8
However, social value, scientific validity,
and favourable risk–benefit ratio raise
specific challenges in international herbal
medicine research that have not been
adequately discussed.
Social value
All research should hold the potential
to achieve social value. Different entities
may view the social value of traditional
medicine research differently. Publichealth officials are often eager to define
the safety and effectiveness of herbal
medicines for conditions such as
malaria.3
 Conversely, harm can arise
with the unscrupulous use of herbs
such as Africa potato (various Hypoxis
species).7
 While some claim that such
medicines have “stood the test of time”,
they nonetheless pose serious challenges
to investigators and regulators from
developed countries, in which standards
of proof are closely linked to proven
efficacy in RCTs. Accordingly, there
has been a serious investment in herbal
medicine research by public-health
bodies in many countries. China
recently launched a safety research
programme focusing on herbal medicine
injections from traditional Chinese
medicine.10 South Africa recently
included the need for investigating
traditional medicines within its national
drug policy.11
In the USA, the National Center
for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine at the National Institutes of
Health spent approximately US$ 33
million on herbal medicines in fiscal
year 2005; in 2004 the National Cancer Institute committed nearly US$ 89
million to studying a range of traditional therapies.12 While this scale of
investment pales in comparison to the
total research and development expenses of the pharmaceutical industry,
it nevertheless reflects genuine public,
industry and governmental interest in
this area.

Collaborative
partnership
Research leadership must include bilateral representation based
on mutual respect between equal partners with community advice.
It includes a responsibility to invest in the scientific training and
capacity-building for ongoing research in a host country where such
resources are not well developed.
Social value Knowledge gained from the research should have the potential to
lead to new generalizable knowledge or improvements in health.
Partners should specify in advance to whom benefits will accrue and
in what way.
Scientific validity Research should be designed to produce beneficial and generalizable
knowledge. This includes designing research so that it can be
feasibly implemented in the settings where it will be conducted.
Fair subject selection Subjects should be selected on the basis of scientific importance, not
based on convenience, vulnerability or bias.
Favourable risk–
benefit ratio
The potential benefits of individual participation should outweigh the
risks of participation. Benefits to the community or population being
studied should also be optimized. Compelling societal benefit can
justify risks to individuals in certain circumstances.
Independent review To maintain the integrity of the research, bodies not tied to the
investigators must agree that the risks and potential benefits of the
research are justified.
Informed consent Investigators must obtain valid permission for study participation from
subjects in a manner that is sensitive to the cultural context in which
the study is conducted.
Respect for subjects Researchers should have a plan for how the research results will be
disseminated; ensuring participants know their right to withdraw, and
monitoring the research for relevant adverse events.
While public-health entities may
be concerned with defining the risks
and benefits of herbal medicines already in use, entrepreneurs and corporations hope herbal medicines may
yield immediate returns from herbal
medicine sales, or yield clues to promising chemical compounds for future
pharmaceutical development. They
test individual herbs, or their components, analysed in state-of-the-art highthroughput screening systems, hoping
to isolate therapeutic phytochemicals
or biologically active functional components. In 2006, Novartis reported
that it would invest over US$ 100 million to investigate traditional medicine
in Shanghai alone.4,5
Nongovernmental organizations
may be primarily interested in preserving indigenous medical knowledge.
One such organization, the Association for the Promotion of Traditional
Medicine (PROMETRA), based in
Dakar, Senegal, is “dedicated to preserving and restoring African traditional
medicine and indigenous science”.13
Governments in developing countries
may want to use traditional herbal
medicine research to expand the influence of their culture’s indigenous
herbal practices in the global healthcare market. For instance, Nigeria’s
president recently established a national
committee on traditional medicine
with the expressed desire to boost
Nigeria’s market share of traditional
medicine.14 In developed countries,
the “need” for this research may be to
protect the public.
The perceived need for the research
may justifiably differ across countries,
but without some basic agreement on
the primary source of social value for
the research it may be difficult to judge
its ultimate impact. In the Africa Flower
case above, before agreements to study
a herbal medicine are decided, partners
must fully discuss potential differences about the perceived “need” for
the research through public forums or
structured debates. Based on these frank
discussions, partners can assess whether
the social values of partner countries
are sufficiently compatible to warrant a
research partnership.

Scientific validity
Part of ensuring the social value of
research includes devising and
implementing sound science. Although
international collaborative research on
herbal medicine is no exception,
discussing scientific validity as an
ethical requirement raises some specific
challenges, including the meaning of
scientific validity, establishing inclusion
and exclusion criteria, using appropriate
outcome measures, and determining
appropriate study designs.
Balancing internal and external
validity
Building a valid basis for knowledge in
herbal medicine will require balancing
two aspects of scientific validity: internal
and external validity.15 Internal validity
means the research must reliably test
hypothesized relationships between an
intervention and an outcome under
controlled conditions. Internally valid
research will typically try to answer a
focused research question that is salient
within the vocabulary and methods of
the scientific community at the time
the research is conducted. External
validity refers to the applicability
of the research results to a target
population outside the experimental
conditions of the research study. External
validity must always be weighed against
the need for rigorous internally valid
research.
This tension between internal and
external validity can be illustrated by a
recent herbal medicine trial of Echinacea angustifolia extract for prevention
of parainfluenza virus infection.16 The
study was conducted under rigorous
experimental conditions, but many
herbalists pointed out that study conditions did not sufficiently reflect how
these medicines are actually used. Null
treatment trial results like these prompt
questions about the external validity
(i.e. value and meaning) of the research.
Was the herbal medicine truly ineffective, or did the experiment not reflect
the herb’s use in “real-world” practice?
In herbal medicine there are often
huge variations in the way in which the
medicines are used in herbalist practice,
including herb source, preparation,
dose and indication. Because traditional herbal medicine practitioners
may be unregulated and their products
lacking in standardization, it may be
difficult to generalize the results from
a formal, structured and highly monitored trial to what will happen in the
widespread dissemination of the herbal
medicine. Nevertheless, herbal medicine research must endeavour to achieve
a balance between internal and external
validity.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To ensure that research results are externally valid, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for research participation
should fit with existing diagnostic categories in the target population specified by the research question. However,
conceptualizations of health and illness
can vary across medical systems and
populations, making agreement on
valid inclusion and exclusion criteria
for international herbal medicine research collaborations more difficult to
achieve.
During the SARS epidemic, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners involved in the care of SARS
patients characterized patients based
on nosological categories derived from
TCM including “deficiency of chi and
yin” as well as “stagnation of pathogenic
phlegm”.17 Designing clinical trials using these kinds of TCM categories as
inclusion criteria would require significant additional effort and biomedical
flexibility to implement. If one wanted
to test whether TCM works for populations in south-east Asia affected by a
SARS-like illness, adapting the science
to include traditional diagnostic categories may be critical for its ultimate
external validity.
If American researchers want to
test a herb’s effects on heart failure, they
might use the New York Heart Association classification as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, this
classification makes little sense from a
TCM perspective, in which heart failure may be viewed primarily as either
a heart yang chi deficiency or a kidney
yang deficiency.18 TCM practitioners
may prefer to categorize patients based
on pulses, tongue examination, and
other elements of traditional diagnosis.
Investigators have simultaneously used
both biomedical entry criteria and
stratified for TCM diagnosis.19 Such an
approach is scientifically ideal because
of its ability to maximize the external
validity of results.
Valid outcome measures
International herbal medicine research
must use outcome measures that accurately capture the effects conferred
by herbal medicines. However, constructs such as “physical functioning”
or “psychological well-being” measured
by the SF-36 quality of life instrument
make little sense within the terminology and ideas of TCM.20 Therefore to
accurately measure a TCM herb’s effects
on quality of life, some investigators
have constructed and validated analoguous measures that more faithfully
detect the effects of TCM interventions that make sense within that healing tradition.20,21 Ideally, when new
measures are introduced, they should
overlap with existing outcome measures, so that the research can adequately contribute to the existing body
of knowledge.
Determining research design
While it is generally agreed that all
human subjects research must maintain
valid study designs, questions arise
about the characteristics of a valid
research design. Two extreme positions
are often defended. At one extreme,
some researchers trained in biomedical
methods of clinical investigation argue
that the only valid source of knowledge
regarding clinical efficacy must come
from one type of research design, the
randomized double blind, placebocontrolled trial. They argue that any
deviations from this gold standard of
scientific validity amount to worthless
science.
At the other extreme, critics of
biomedical research conducted on traditional medicines charge that attempts
to evaluate traditional therapies with
biomedical methodologies may fail to
generate true knowledge, since that
knowledge itself depends on a scientific
vocabulary that only makes sense from
within the concepts of biomedicine.22–24
They worry that “standard notions of
... experimental design criteria represent an imperialistic ‘western’ mode of
thinking”.22,24
Research on herbal medicines
should typically employ experimental
research designs such as the RCT. Even
if research tools (including the RCT)
are imperfect,25 they are thus far the
best methods we have for furthering
our knowledge.9,15 Consider how RCT
designs could be implemented in TCM,
Special theme – Ethics public health

in which treatments are individualized to patients, often incorporating
several, or even dozens, of herbs in a
customized preparation. Despite these
complexities, investigators have successfully adapted double-blind RCT
designs to complex individually tailored Chinese herbs. Bensoussan et al.
conducted a three-arm trial in which
they tested the comparative clinical efficacy of standard complex herbal medicines, customized therapy and placebo.26
Standard and customized therapy were
comparably beneficial as compared to
placebo. In other instances, cluster
RCTs can allow for practitioner variability, while still rigorously testing the
efficacy of a therapeutic approach. In
cross-cultural settings, researchers cannot merely adopt alternative designs
in an ad hoc manner, but must reflect
on and refine their research question,
and find a design that best answers the
research question within the given cultural context.
In recent years, growing attention
has been paid to a group of additional
important ethical issues surrounding
publication bias, financial conflicts of
interest, and clinical trial registries. In
the arena of traditional herbal medicine, these same issues apply, and when
cross-cultural differences exist in the
definitions of valid science, as is the case
in traditional herbal medicine research,
these questions compound. For instance,
until recently, there was a tendency to
see only positive studies published in
China. It is, therefore, critically important to the long-term scientific credibility of international traditional herbal
medicine research that, at the outset,
partners agree about the standards
of scientific conduct, the disclosure of
financial relationships, registration of
clinical trials, and adequate reporting
of trial results.
Favourable risk–benefit ratio
In international herbal medicine research, several practical challenges arise
in making accurate risk–benefit determinations. Typically, in American
pharmaceutical development, a stepwise process of drug testing occurs – a
compound is isolated, tested in tissue
cultures and animals, and then investigated in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials.
However, herbal medicines are already
in widespread use, are often used in
combination, and are drawn from plant
sources with their own variability in
species, growing conditions and biologically active constituents. They often
come into use by a process of trial and
error, or over centuries. Accordingly, in
clinical herbal medicine research there
is rarely a strong preclinical basis for
dosing, and there are significant looming questions about product purity,
quality, chemical stability and active
constituents at the time herbal medicine trials are proposed.27,28
Initiating large-scale research trials
in such circumstances raises questions
about whether the risks and benefits of
research participation can be accurately
ascertained. Those reviewing protocols
should factor in the uncertainty associated with product variability in
determining whether a herbal medicine
trial has a favourable risk–benefit ratio.
However, protocol reviewers (i.e. institutional review boards) should not presume that because they are personally
unfamiliar with a herbal preparation
that there is no credible or valuable
background evidence regarding safety
and potential efficacy. While researchers should provide such information
in protocol materials, reviewers must
remain aware of the role their own lack
of familiarity may play in their ultimate
judgements of risks and benefits of the
research.
Researchers increasingly agree that
it is important to establish a rational
basis for dosing and standardization of
biologically active compounds before
conducting large-scale treatment trials.29,30 These efforts can improve investigators’ ability to assess the risks and
benefits of participation in large-scale
herbal medicine trials. Likewise, more
rigorous monitoring of adverse events
and standardized reporting of research
results for both safety and efficacy data
will improve long-term efforts to enhance risk–benefit ratio determination
for trial participation.31
Cultural factors also may influence
judgements of the risks and benefits
in herbal medicine research. For instance, a cultural familiarity with many
traditional Chinese herbal medicines
in China may promote a familiarity
bias, accepting a widespread cultural
assumption of safety, based on the historical use of herbal medicines.32 There
may also be a cultural difference in
emphasis placed on standardized adverse events reporting in China.33 These
cultural differences make achieving
agreed-upon standards of favourable
risk–benefit ratio more difficult. In
order for international collaborative
herbal medicine research to achieve its
objectives, it will be important to establish standards of evidence for demonstration of safety before conducting
large-scale clinical trials evaluating the
efficacy of herbal medicines.
Improving science through
collaborative partnership
How can international collaborative
herbal medicine trials achieve the
ethical requirements outlined above?
Collaborative partnership, the first
requirement for international research
ethics, provides both the rationale and
the context for achieving appropriate
application of the other ethical requirements. Partners in these collaborations
must share vocabulary for all the requirements, especially for social value,
scientific validity, and favourable risk–
benefit ratio. How can agreed-upon
language be achieved? As illustrated
here, these challenges are significant. In
the case presented earlier, investigators
should have reservations about implementing a large-scale clinical trial for
Africa Flower. Nevertheless, the local
interest in this substance may be valid
and deserve some additional preliminary investigation. Collaborative partnership displays a commitment by all
parties in international research agreements to work together for common
language and goals.
To achieve collaborative partnership, parties can engage in structured
methods of democratic deliberation to
devise shared language and concepts for
research. These methods have been used
to bring different parties together in a
safe and collegial process of decisionmaking.34 Over time, collaborations
could “cross-train” basic and clinical
investigators to more fully appreciate the
concepts and practices of the traditional
herbal medicine traditions, and developing host countries would need to develop the basic literacy, knowledge and
skills among traditional medicine practitioners so that they see the value of
rigorous clinical research.2
 With a sustained investment like this, it will become increasingly possible to conduct
sound international scientific investigation on traditional herbal medicine.
Furthermore, sustainable collaborative
research partnerships would benefit

from robust and independent adverseevent reporting systems for herbal
medicines so that the risk–benefit ratio
for herbal medicine research can be
more clearly defined.
Ethical challenges in international
traditional herbal medicine call for a
comprehensive framework. Addressing
